# Nearest Low-Rank Correlation Matrix

This GitHub repository gathers all code developed in the context of the master’s thesis *"Nearest correlation matrix with low-rank structure: a problem from finance"*, completed at EPL (École Polytechnique de Louvain, UCL) by Audren Balon.

The structure of the code follows the chapters of the thesis. For example, `sec4_1` corresponds to Section 1 of Chapter 4, and `app_3` refers to the third appendix.

**Usage note:**  
Before running the codes, make sure you have the large portfolio matrix of size 18,895 × 18,895. The file is very heavy so not possible to upload in Github : this is a confidential data shared by Antoine Vandendorpe from BNP. 

Most of the key results are located in the folders named `Results_SNM_...`.
